# MEC E 692 – Assignment 1

**Author:** Seyed Amin Chabok

## Description

This repository contains the Python code developed for **Assignment 1** of **MEC E 692**.  
The code generates a high-resolution plot of the function

\[
f(x) = \ln(x^4) - 0.7
\]

## Mathematical Background

The positive real root of the equation

\[
\ln(x^4) = 0.7
\]

is given analytically by:

\[
x = e^{0.175} \approx 1.1912
\]

This root is visually identified on the graph.


```bash
python plot_ln_x4_minus_0p7.py
